<!-- Notice the plain text at the top of the file. 
     Jekyll calls this the Front-matter. Any file 
     on your site that contains this will be processed 
     by Jekyll. Every time you commit a file that specifies 
     layout: default at the top, Jekyll will magically 
     generate the full HTML document by replacing 
     {{ content }} in _layouts/default.html with the contents 
     of the committed file. Awesome! -->
